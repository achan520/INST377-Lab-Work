<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it, but that form will not need an action
    You will need to add the attribute "name" to your input
    with a value of 'resto'

    You will need to hook your script.js to this file for the midterm to work
    you will need a "filter" button with a type of "button" and a
    "load data" button with a type of "submit" on it
-->
<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Try typing 'doc' at the top of this file and pressing "tab" -->
<!-- if your development environment is set up correctly -->
<!-- the Emmett plugin will set this file up for you -->

<!-- Requirements -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it with an 'action' to /api and a single text field with an id/name of "resto" -->
<!-- If you open /routes/apiRoutes and go to line 38 you will find the server side answer to your request! -->

<!-- This week doesn't have a script.js file in it, because you're focusing on HTML and CSS -->
