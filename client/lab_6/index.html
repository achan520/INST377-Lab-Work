<!--
    This is how to build the CSS-only load animation from loading.io    
    <div class="lds-ellipsis"><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

    This is helpful for showing your client-side users when data is loading,
    since there's otherwise no sign your app is thinking about something!

    Try placing it at the same level in your element tree as your Submit button
-->
<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it, but that form will not need an action
    You will need to add the attribute "name" to your input
    with a value of 'resto'

    You will need to hook your script.js to this file for the midterm to work
    you will need a "filter" button with a type of "button" and a
    "load data" button with a type of "submit" on it
-->
<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Try typing 'doc' at the top of this file and pressing "tab" -->
<!-- if your development environment is set up correctly -->
<!-- the Emmett plugin will set this file up for you -->

<!-- Requirements -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it with an 'action' to /api and a single text field with an id/name of "resto" -->
<!-- If you open /routes/apiRoutes and go to line 38 you will find the server side answer to your request! -->

<!-- This week doesn't have a script.js file in it, because you're focusing on HTML and CSS -->
